The toolbox provides a lot of high-quality software running on MATLAB for standard and advanced analysis of EEG signals. 
Mind thay its use is not compulsory for the project. I recommend using it especially if you want to learn more on EEG analysis (for example, it can be very useful if you intend to do your thesis on this topic).

I have also uploaded the function "topoplot" and some other functions necessary to use it so that you can do topoplots (topographic maps) withouth having to use the toolbox itself
